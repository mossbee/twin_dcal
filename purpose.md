- This repo adapt the idea of research in main.tex to a similar task: training an identical twin faces verification model (given two face image, tell whether they are same person or not). Because the identical twin faces verification task is also a fine-grained image verification task.
- Dataset are detected, aligned face images size 448x448, dataset structure is stored in dataset_infor.json, which is a dictionary, with keys are person id and values are list of image paths. The minimum number of image each person is 4, maximum is 68, total image are 6182, total number of person is 353. A test dataset is in a different place.
- There is a twin_pairs_infor.json, which is a list of pairs of twin id.
- I have two 2080Ti GPU(cuda:0, cuda:1). The training Ubuntu server is strictly on sending data to the internet, but there is a locally hosted MLFlow service for training tracking.
- Since 6182 images from 353 ids is not a big dataset, so I want to use the dataset to the fullest.
